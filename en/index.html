                            <p>In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the formal beginning of AI as a field of study.
                                Researchers envisioned creating machines that could "think" like humans.
                                Early experiments included symbolic reasoning and problem-solving.
                                This foundational moment laid the groundwork for decades of innovation.
                                AI's journey had officially begun.</p>
