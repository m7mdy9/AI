In order to make the RUN.bat file actually work and run the site you have to make sure that the default app that opens .html files is a browser
Otherwise to open the file you'll have to:
- Drag and drop the index.html file in the main folder into your browser
OR
- Open the site https://m7mdy9.github.io/AI
OR
- Copy the path of the index.html file and put it in the address bar of your browser
(e.g. D:\AI_Website\index.html)
OR
- Right click the index.html file and choose open with and select your browser (e.g. Google Chrome)
